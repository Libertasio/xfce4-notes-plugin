 Xfce4 Notes Plugin
====================

The notes plugin provides you a quick way to write down a todo list,
to paste a piece of code, to leave a note to your friend, or whatever
else you had like to do with a post'it.

		___Todo_list___
	
	☑ Show an example
	☑ Show some UTF8 codes
	☐ Release a new version
	
		___Random_thoughts___
	
	☐ Add bold/italic/… style
	☐ Hope this gives you some ideas
	
		___UTF8_codes___
	
	Type Ctrl+Shift+u in GTK+ applications
	
	— 2014		“ 201C
	” 201D		‣ 2023
	… 2026		⁂ 2042
	☐ 2610		☑ 2611

The notes are saved under $XDG_DATA_HOME/notes/[0]. This way you can
continue to access your notes remotely, if you have a SSH account for
example, and fire up your favorite editor ^_~

[0] $XDG_DATA_HOME is an environment variable defined by the XDG base
directory specification[1] and defaults to $HOME/.local/share.

You most probably want to tweak Xfwm4 by disabling the “Skip windows
that have skip pager or skip taskbar properties set” (cf. Settings >
Window Manager Tweaks > Cycling). The reason is that the notes plugin
sets the skip pager hint so it doesn't clutter your pager, but you still
want to access your notes by cycling to them (Alt+Tab by default).
