 Xfce4-notes-plugin
====================

The notes plugin provides you a quick way to write down a todo list,
to paste a piece of code, to leave a note to your friend, or whatever
else you had like to do with it.

    “ I like to write down a todo list and mark what I did,
    and once I'm done with the whole job I destroy the note.
    
        x this is done
        - check that
        - do this too
        ? maybe work on that
    
    Hope this gives you some ideas ”, Mike

The notes are saved under $XDG_DATA_HOME/notes/[0].  This way you can
continue to access your notes remotely, if you have a SSH account for
example, and fire up your favorite editor ;-)

[0] $XDG_DATA_HOME is an environment variable defined by the XDG base
directory specification and defaults to $HOME/.local/share.  

You probably want to uncheck the option “Skip windows that have "skip
pager" or "skip taskbar" properties set” of xfwm4 (Settings > Window
Manager Tweaks > Cycling).  The reason is that the notes plugin sets
the skip pager hint so it doesn't clutter your pager, but you still
want to access your notes by cycling to them (Alt+Tab).
